The LIOAnyEpaule model consists in an inverse dynamic musculoskeletal model for
shoulder griddle study. More specifically, it has been developed with the
objective to be used for non-conforming total shoulder arthroplasty (NC-TSA)
evaluation. Development, verification and validation of this model was one of
the objectives of a PhD study. Method and results are published in the Journal
of Biomechanical Engineering:

*NB:* Due to copyright restrictions, the glenoid and humeral components files are
not the same than the one used in the published paper. The provided stl models
are CAO custom made models, that do not correspond to any commercialy availade
implant. For this reason, results when using the model _as is_ will necessarily
be different.
