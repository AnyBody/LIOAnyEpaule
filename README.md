# LIOAnyEpaule
LIOAnyEpaule (En: LIOAnyShoulder) is a musculoskeletal model for non-conforming
total shoulder arthroplasty (NC-TSA) evaluation.

The LIOAnyEpaule model consists in an inverse dynamic musculoskeletal model for
shoulder griddle study. More specifically, it has been developed with the
objective to be used for non-conforming total shoulder arthroplasty (NC-TSA)
evaluation. Development, verification and validation of this model was one of
the objectives of a PhD study. Method and results are published in the Journal
of Biomechanical Engineering:
